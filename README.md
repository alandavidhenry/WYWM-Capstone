<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Welcome to the repository for my With You With Me Capstone website. This was submitted as my capstone project for employment with With You With Me.

I was tasked with creating an online shop selling merchandise for With You With Me. This included t-shirts and books. The website had to use Angular and TypeScript.



### Built With

[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
[Angular](https://angular.dev)
[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)

#### HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to structure the content of my website. It provides the basic building blocks for all web pages.

#### TailwindCSS

For styling, I opted for TailwindCSS because:

* It provides a utility-first approach, allowing for rapid UI development.
* It's highly customizable, enabling me to create a unique design that reflects my personal brand.
* The built-in purge feature ensures that only the CSS I use is included in the final build, resulting in a smaller file size.

#### TypeScript and Angular

JavaScript adds interactivity to my website. It allows me to calculate the total cost of the aircraft in real time as the user changes the quantity and adds optional extras.

#### Deployment

I deployed the website using Firebase hosting as it is simple to deploy using the Firebase CLI and free to use.
